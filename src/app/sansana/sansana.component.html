Sanasana is a sustainability-focused startup I co-founded to help logistics companies in Africa reduce fuel costs and emissions through smart software. I led the development of Spark, our core product — a hardware-free fleet optimization tool.

⚙️ What I Did
Product Research & Discovery: Interviewed logistics teams in Ghana, Kenya, and Uganda to understand pain points around fuel consumption, trip planning, and asset tracking.

UX Design & Frontend Development: Created user flows, wireframes, and built key parts of the frontend using [add tools/stack].

Feature Definition & Roadmapping: Prioritized features like trip planning, route optimization, and fuel variance tracking. Managed iterations and MVP rollout.

Marketing & Brand Strategy: Developed brand voice, product messaging, and launched our content marketing engine. Drove early traction through targeted outreach and thought leadership.

📊 Impact
Improved fuel tracking accuracy for pilot users by 15%

Enabled small fleets to digitize operations without hardware

Helped clients cross-check expected vs. actual fuel spend, reducing waste and fraud
