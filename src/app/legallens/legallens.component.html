        Legal Lens is a web-based legal research tool built to help lawyers in Ghana save time and make better-informed <br>
        decisions by surfacing relevant precedents and case summaries through a searchable, structured interface. <br>

        The idea emerged from speaking with legal professionals who expressed frustration with the manual,
        time-consuming <br> process of researching case law ‚Äî often involving scanning PDFs or relying on scattered,outdated
        archives.
