        Legal Lens is a web-based legal research tool built to help lawyers in Ghana save time and make better-informed
        decisions by surfacing relevant precedents and case summaries through a searchable, structured interface.

        The idea emerged from speaking with legal professionals who expressed frustration with the manual,
        time-consuming process of researching case law ‚Äî often involving scanning PDFs or relying on scattered, outdated
        archives.

        We designed Legal Lens to:

        Allow lawyers to search by keywords, case topics, or precedent type

        Display summarized judgments and highlight key legal principles

        Provide filters by jurisdiction, year, or court level for quick navigation

        The platform was created with a focus on clarity, simplicity, and relevance, catering to both new and
        experienced legal practitioners.
