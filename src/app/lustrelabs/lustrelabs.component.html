        1. Product Development: Researched and formulated sustainable, plant-based skincare using African ingredients
        like shea butter, cocoa butter, and black soap.
        <br>
        2. Brand Strategy: Created the brand identity from scratch ‚Äî name, tone, visuals, and packaging ‚Äî with a focus
        on heritage, clean beauty, and wellness.
        <br>
        3. E-commerce: Designed and launched the online store via Shopify, integrating payment systems, logistics, and
        basic analytics.
        <br>
        4. Community & Marketing: Led all content creation across Instagram and newsletters, developed educational
        content on ingredients and rituals, and built a loyal, values-aligned audience.
        <br>
        5. Growth & Collaborations: Partnered with fitness studios and wellness spaces to host experiential events that
        connected the brand to self-expression and empowerment.
